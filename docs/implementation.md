# Implementation Guide

This guide provides practical approaches for implementing ASPT in various environments.

## Prompt Engineering Approach

For immediate implementation with existing AI systems, the following prompt structure can be used:

```
SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:
When generating code, you must follow the AI Stitching Programming Technique (ASPT):

1. Generate no more than [X] lines of code at a time
2. After each section, perform a "Shallow Stitch" review focusing on:
   - Syntax and style consistency
   - Variable naming conventions
   - Documentation completeness
   - Basic logical correctness
3. After completing a functional component, perform a "Medium Stitch" review focusing on:
   - Edge case handling
   - Error management
   - Input validation
   - Return value consistency
   - Test coverage
4. At major integration points, perform a "Deep Stitch" review focusing on:
   - Component integration
   - Architectural consistency
   - Performance and security
   - System-level concerns

For each review cycle, explicitly identify issues found and refine the code before proceeding.
```

## Orchestration Framework

For more robust implementation, an orchestration system should:

1. **Track Generation State**: Maintain awareness of what has been generated
2. **Monitor Triggers**: Automatically detect when review cycles should occur
3. **Manage Context**: Provide relevant context during review cycles
4. **Record Issues**: Track problems found during reviews
5. **Enforce Refinement**: Ensure identified issues are addressed
6. **Adapt Dynamically**: Adjust review frequency based on issue density

## Model Fine-tuning Considerations

When fine-tuning models to inherently support ASPT:

1. **Training Data**: Include examples of code generation with review cycles
2. **Reward Functions**: Reinforce detection of issues during review phases
3. **Context Management**: Improve retention of previously generated code
4. **Metadata Signals**: Train models to recognize checkpoint triggers

## Integration with Development Methodologies

ASPT can be integrated with existing software development approaches:

### Agile Integration
- Incorporate review cycles within sprint structures
- Add ASPT metrics to sprint retrospectives
- Align shallow, medium, and deep stitches with different phases of the sprint

### DevOps Integration
- Embed ASPT in CI/CD pipelines
- Automate review cycle triggers as part of the build process
- Include ASPT metrics in deployment approval gates

### Enterprise Implementation
- Phase ASPT adoption based on project criticality
- Integrate with governance and compliance requirements
- Establish review standards for regulated industries

## Implementation Timeline

For organizations adopting ASPT, consider this phased approach:

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Activities |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| **1. Pilot** | Limited scope | 1-2 months | - Select small project<br>- Establish baseline metrics<br>- Implement prompt-based ASPT |
| **2. Evaluation** | Effectiveness | 2-4 weeks | - Compare metrics to baseline<br>- Gather developer feedback<br>- Refine implementation |
| **3. Expansion** | Team adoption | 2-3 months | - Train development teams<br>- Create custom tools<br>- Refine for specific domains |
| **4. Integration** | DevOps pipeline | 3-4 months | - Automate review cycles<br>- Connect with existing tools<br>- Establish governance |
| **5. Optimization** | Performance | Ongoing | - Fine-tune review triggers<br>- Enhance tooling<br>- Share best practices |
