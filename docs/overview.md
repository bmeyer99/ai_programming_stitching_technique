# Overview

The AI Stitching Programming Technique (ASPT) is a systematic methodology for improving AI-generated code through periodic review cycles. Inspired by the back-and-forth motion of hand stitching, ASPT requires AI coding agents to "stitch back" and review recently written code before proceeding to new functionality.

This iterative approach addresses the common problem where AI systems can effectively scaffold code structures but struggle with implementing complex logic consistently throughout a project.

## The Problem

Current AI code generation approaches typically exhibit several limitations:

1. **Linear Progression**: AI tends to write code in a straight-line manner without adequately reviewing previous work.
2. **Incomplete Logic**: Complex conditional paths and edge cases are often left unimplemented.
3. **Context Loss**: As code grows, AI loses track of earlier design decisions and implementation details.
4. **Inconsistent Patterns**: Variable naming, error handling, and other patterns drift throughout the codebase.
5. **Inadequate Testing**: Test coverage diminishes for later components in the generation sequence.

The ASPT methodology directly addresses these challenges through structured review cycles.

## Core Principles

ASPT is built on four fundamental principles:

1. **Periodic Review**: Code generation is punctuated by scheduled review cycles
2. **Depth Variation**: Different review cycles focus on different levels of code quality
3. **Context Preservation**: Each review reinforces the AI's understanding of the overall system
4. **Continuous Refinement**: Code quality improves through iterative review and revision
