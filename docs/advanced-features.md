# Advanced Features

Beyond the core specification, ASPT can be extended with these advanced capabilities.

## 1. Multi-level Stitching
Implementing nested review cycles for hierarchical components and scheduled "grand reviews" for broader architectural patterns.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Define component hierarchy at project start
- Schedule shallow stitches for individual components
- Apply medium stitches at subsystem boundaries
- Conduct deep stitches for major system integrations
- Schedule comprehensive "grand reviews" at project milestones

## 2. Adaptive Stitching
Dynamically adjusting review frequency based on detected error rates and code complexity.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Track error detection rates during reviews
- Increase review frequency for high-error components
- Decrease frequency for consistently clean components
- Use complexity metrics to trigger additional reviews
- Implement feedback loops for continuous optimization

## 3. Collaborative Stitching
Integrating human developers into the review cycle at strategic points, creating a human-AI pair programming experience.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Identify optimal intervention points for human review
- Create standardized human feedback mechanisms
- Implement priority-based escalation to human reviewers
- Design UI for efficient human-AI collaboration
- Develop knowledge transfer protocols between humans and AI

## 4. Contextual Memory
Building specialized memory structures to maintain awareness of the overall system design during focused component work.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create graph-based representation of code components
- Maintain active links between related components
- Implement relevance scoring for context retrieval
- Design efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Develop forgetting curves for non-critical information

## 5. Domain-Specific Adaptations
Customizing review criteria for different domains (finance, healthcare, embedded systems) and programming languages.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create domain-specific review checklists
- Define language-specific validation rules
- Implement regulatory compliance checks for relevant domains
- Develop specialized security reviews for sensitive domains
- Build extensible framework for custom domain adaptations

## 6. Multi-Agent Coordination
Enabling multiple AI agents to work collaboratively using ASPT.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Specialization**: Different agents focus on generation vs. review
- **Handoff Protocol**: Standardized information exchange between agents
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Resolution of conflicting review feedback
- **Division of Responsibility**: Partitioning of system components
- **Collective Context**: Shared understanding of the overall system

See the [Multi-Agent Handoff Protocol](handoff-protocol.md) for detailed implementation.

## 7. Learning and Adaptation
Implementing feedback loops to improve ASPT effectiveness over time.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying common issue patterns
- **Predictive Triggers**: Anticipating when reviews will be most valuable
- **Adaptive Depth**: Learning optimal review depth for different components
- **Knowledge Base**: Building repositories of review findings for reference

## 8. Legacy Code Integration
Strategies for applying ASPT to existing codebases.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Incremental Adoption**: Applying ASPT to new components within legacy systems
- **Code Archaeology**: Using ASPT to understand and document existing code
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining AI and human reviews for legacy systems
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Targeted reviews of high-risk legacy components

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing these advanced features:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with core ASPT before adding advanced features
2. **Measure Impact**: Evaluate effectiveness of each feature individually
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Implement advanced features incrementally
4. **Customize**: Adapt features to specific organizational needs
5. **Feedback Loops**: Continuously refine based on results
