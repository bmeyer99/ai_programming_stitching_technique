# Evaluation Framework

To measure the effectiveness of ASPT implementation, consider these metrics:

| Metric | Description | Measurement Tool | Target |
|--------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| **Defect Density** | Number of bugs per KLOC (thousand lines of code) | SonarQube, CodeClimate | 50% reduction |
| **Issue Detection Rate** | Percentage of injected issues found | Controlled testing framework | >80% |
| **Completion Accuracy** | Adherence to requirements | Requirements traceability matrix | >90% coverage |
| **Consistency Score** | Pattern adherence throughout codebase | Static analyzers (ESLint, Pylint) | >85% adherence |
| **Review Efficiency** | Time spent in review vs. generation | Process monitoring tools | 1:3 ratio |
| **Knowledge Retention** | Accuracy of references to earlier code | Context evaluation tests | >75% accuracy |

Each organization implementing ASPT should establish baseline measurements before adoption to effectively track improvements.

## Measurement Approaches

### Defect Density
1. Implement the same feature with and without ASPT
2. Run comprehensive test suites against both implementations
3. Compare number of discovered defects

### Issue Detection Rate
1. Deliberately introduce known issues into code
2. Apply ASPT review cycles
3. Calculate percentage of issues discovered

### Completion Accuracy
1. Create detailed requirements specifications
2. Implement using ASPT
3. Track percentage of requirements successfully implemented

### Consistency Score
1. Define coding standards and patterns
2. Implement using ASPT
3. Measure adherence to defined standards

### Review Efficiency
1. Track time spent in generation vs. review phases
2. Establish optimal ratio for different project types
3. Adjust review frequency based on findings

### Knowledge Retention
1. Test AI's ability to recall earlier design decisions
2. Measure accuracy of references to previously generated code
3. Track consistency of approach throughout the project

## Benchmarking

For objective evaluation, benchmark ASPT against:

1. **Standard AI code generation** (without review cycles)
2. **Human-reviewed AI generation** (where humans perform reviews)
3. **Pair programming** (human-human collaboration)

Use consistent metrics across all approaches to determine relative effectiveness.
