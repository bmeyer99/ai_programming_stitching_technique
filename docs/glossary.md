# Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ASPT** | AI Stitching Programming Technique - cyclical review methodology for AI code generation |
| **Shallow Stitch (SS)** | First-level review focusing on syntax, style, and basic correctness |
| **Medium Stitch (MS)** | Second-level review focusing on logical correctness and robustness |
| **Deep Stitch (DS)** | Third-level review focusing on architecture and system integration |
| **Checkpoint Trigger** | Event that initiates a review cycle |
| **KLOC** | Thousand Lines Of Code - metric used for measuring code size and defect density |
| **Review Cycle** | Complete process of reviewing and refining code |
| **Orchestration Layer** | System that manages the ASPT implementation |
